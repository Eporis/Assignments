In January 2021 three classmates and I competed in the Ivey Health Sector Club's 7th annual Healthcare Leadership and Innovation Challenge.
The theme of the conference was ADAPT - a reference to the global need to adapt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The case competition required our team to solve issues a Midwestern health group was facing in implementing mental health services for their 
staff, particularly their doctors. The major issue was that the doctors were feeling increasingly burnt out as the pandemic raged on yet felt
unable to use the in-house mental health services for fear of stigma and potential sanctions that could affect their licensing.

Our teams solutions focused on outsourcing the mental health services to alleviate fear of sanctions and implementing systems that would 
decrease the stigma the doctors felt about seeking said services.

I'm proud to say that in the 19 hours we had to read, analyze, brainstorm and put together a presentation on the case we put together something
that reflected our passions about healthcare and our excellent group cohesion. I clearly wasn't the only one who felt this way,
as we made it the semifinals, finishing 2nd out of 20 teams.
