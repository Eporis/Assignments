This assignment was the final project for my "Coding Essentials" course at Western University in the Fall of my 2018. The course used Python 
and covered the basics of data structures, Boolean logic, and loops, all the way to machine learning in a semester.

The final project had two components:
1) Find a data set online and program a machine learning model to predict something useful from it, visualize the results, and comment on 
   how the model did and what the results mean.

2) Find the description of a sorting algorithm we hadn't covered in class (e.g. selection) online and code it from 
   scratch. We were also to code in ways of measuring the performance of the sorting algorithm and comment on them.


For the machine learning model, I found a data set on a red and white varietal of a portuguese wine that had chemical attributes of the wines
as well as qualitative ratings by critics. The goal of the model was to use the chemical breakdowns to predict (1) whether it was red or white
and (2) what score it would receive. The model was successful in predicting the color of the wine, but less successful in scoring them. 

For the sorting algorithm I chose heap sort as I was interested in the idea of conceptualizing data as a heap structure, and I was quite happy
with the results as it vastly outperformed selection sort which we had learned in class.


Overall, this was a really fun project for me, and one that I look back on along with the rest of the course as inspiring me to pursue a career
in either programming or data science!
